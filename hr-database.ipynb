    "\n",
    "Tech ABC Corp saw explosive growth with a sudden appearance onto the gaming scene with their new AI-powered video game console. As a result, they have gone from a small 10 person operation to 200 employees and 5 locations in under a year. HR is having trouble keeping up with the growth, since they are still maintaining employee information in a spreadsheet. While that worked for ten employees, it has becoming increasingly cumbersome to manage as the company expands.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, the HR department has tasked the data architect to design and build a database capable of managing their employee information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The [HR dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14SgnE_0wNpuPdF5ss94GGqIBfcxLnpIF/view) consists of 206 records with eleven columns. The data is in human readable format, and has not been normalized at all. The data lists the names of employees at Tech ABC Corp as well as information such as job title, department, manager's name, hire date, start date, end date, work location, and salary.\n",

    "Hi,\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Tech ABC Corp. We are excited to have some new talent onboard. As you may already know, Tech ABC Corp has recently experienced a lot of growth. Our AI powered video game console WOPR has been hugely successful and as a result, our company has grown from 10 employees to 200 in only 6 months (and we are projecting a 20% growth a year for the next 5 years). We have also grown from our Dallas, Texas office, to 4 other locations nationwide: New York City, NY, San Francisco, CA, Minneapolis, MN, and Nashville, TN.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this growth is great, it is really starting to put a strain on our record keeping in HR. We currently maintain all employee information on a shared spreadsheet. When HR consisted of only myself, managing everyone on an Excel spreadsheet was simple, but now that it is a shared document I am having serious reservations about data integrity and data security. If the wrong person got their hands on the HR file, they would see the salaries of every employee in the company, all the way up to the president.\n",
    "\n",
    "After speaking with Jacob Lauber, the manager of IT, he suggested I put in a request to have my HR Excel file converted into a database. He suggested I reach out to you as I am told you have experience in designing and building databases. When you are building this, please keep in mind that I want any employee with a domain login to be have read only access the database. I just don't want them having access to salary information. That needs to be restricted to HR and management level employees only. Management and HR employees should also be the only ones with write access. By our current estimates, 90% of users will be read only.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also want to make sure you know that am looking to turn my spreadsheet into a live database, one I can input and edit information into. I am not really concerned with reporting capabilities at the moment. Since we are working with employee data we are required by federal regulations to maintain this data for at least 7 years; additionally, since this is considered business critical data, we need to make sure it gets backed up properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final consideration. We would like to be able to connect with the payroll department's system in the future. They maintain employee attendance and paid time off information. It would be nice if the two systems could interface in the future\n",
    "\n",
    "I am looking forward to working with you and seeing what kind of database you design for us.\n",
